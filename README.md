# XAI4EarthNet2022

Forecasting the state of vegetation in response to climate and weather events is a major challenge. Requena and al. (2021) [1] define the land surface forecasting task as a strongly guided video prediction task where the objective is to forecast the vegetation developing at very fine resolution using topography and weather variables to guide the prediction. Several papers have addressed this issue, . (accepted! currently under review :D)

#### EarthNet2022, a new brand dataset

*Please note:* This new dataset will most likely **not** be available and public by the end of the project. However, a sample (or few if needed) will be available, as well as the jupyters used to explore the data. 


### Explainable IA (XAI) 
However, theses models have often a low explainability.  **Bring your own method**
