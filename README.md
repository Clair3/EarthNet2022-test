# XAI4EarthNet2022

Forecasting the state of vegetation in response to climate and weather events is a major challenge. Requena and al. (2021) [1] define the land surface forecasting task as a strongly guided video prediction task where the objective is to forecast the vegetation developing at very fine resolution using topography and weather variables to guide the prediction. Several papers have addressed this issue, . (accepted! currently under review :D)

#### EarthNet2022, a new brand dataset

*Please note:* This new dataset will most likely **not be publicly available** by the end of the project. However, a sample (or few if needed) will be available, as well as the jupyters used to explore the data. 


### Explainable IA (XAI) 
However, theses models have often a low explainability.  **Bring your own method**

### Approach

### Work-breakdown structure 
 * Data collection: 0 hours
 * Data understanding and exploration: 15 hours
 ... understanding the distribution 
 * Framework: 20 hours   
PyTorch lighnight framework
 * Optimisation: 20 hours   
There is a potentially important grain to be gained through a more rigorous optimization (try different optimiser, use a schudeler) 
 * Explainability: 50 hours
 * Building an application: 30 hours   
I don't have any knowledge in web development or application, so it will probably take time and it is difficult to evaluate. The idea would be to develop a (simple) web page with an access to the model and a (sub)set of samples from the test test. Select a sample on the map, and generate its prediction as well as the analyses of the prediction.
 * Final report: 15 hours
 * Presentation: 10 hours
 * Total: 160 hours
